        <p><strong style="color: #F81B84;">1stDayHack</strong> is one of the first hackathon in Malaysia that caters specifically to secondary high school students. The goal is to <strong style="color: #F81B84;">inspire, engage and give hands-on experience</strong> to the next generation of Malaysian youths in the cutting edge of modern computing technology - <strong style="color: #F81B84;">Machine Learning</strong>. 
            We will be bringing together <strong style="color: #F81B84;">60 students</strong> from various schools, public and private, 
            across 2 days to learn and develop software that are highly <strong style="color: #F81B84;">practical and technologically sophisticated</strong>, not merely a coding exercise. 
            Included in the program are various talks, dedicated workshops and tutorials to provide sufficient foundation in topics such as fundamentals of programming and product design. 
            In addition, a dedicated mentor will be assigned to each team to guide them throughout the entire experience.
